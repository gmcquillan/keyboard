Keyboard
========

Microcontroller code for a one handed keyboard.

The aim is to help people suffering from carpel tunnel or any other issues which might 
prevent them from using a hand, while simultaneously preserving a keyboard layout
which they might already be accustomed to. 

Here's a photo of the prototype hardware so far:
